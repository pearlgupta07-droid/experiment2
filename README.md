Experiment 1.2.3 – SVG Drawing Tool
📌 Aim
To design and implement an interactive SVG-based drawing tool using mouse event handling in a web browser.
🎯 Objectives
* To create an SVG canvas for drawing
* To track mouse events for freehand drawing
* To dynamically generate SVG path elements
* To build a responsive and user-friendly layout
* To understand coordinate transformation in SVG
🛠️ Technologies Used
* HTML5
* CSS3
* JavaScript
* SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics)
🧩 Description
This project implements a freehand drawing tool using SVG.
The user can draw smoothly on the SVG canvas by dragging the mouse.
Mouse screen coordinates are converted into SVG coordinates using SVG transformation methods, allowing accurate rendering of drawings.
The interface is designed with a split layout where the drawing canvas is placed on the left side, similar to standard digital drawing or signature tools.
⚙️ Features
* Freehand drawing using mouse movement
* Dynamic SVG `<path>` creation
* Responsive layout using CSS
* Clean and minimal UI suitable for lab experiments
▶️ How to Run
1. Download or clone the repository
2. Open `index.html` in any modern browser (Chrome / Firefox recommended)
3. Use the mouse to draw inside the SVG canvas
📚 Learning Outcomes
* Understanding SVG coordinate systems
* Handling mouse events in JavaScript
* Dynamic DOM manipulation
* Implementing interactive web graphics
🏫 Academic Use
This project is developed as part of **Experiment 1.2.3 – SVG Drawing Tool** for Web Technologies / Frontend Development laboratory work.
